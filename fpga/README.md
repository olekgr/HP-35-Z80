# HP-35-Z80


What is FPGA doing in this project? Well, beeing VHDL fan, all work on the HP35 clone was done on the thing shown in the photo. In the xilinx XC6SLX9 I implemented the T80 core from Opencores with all accompanying circuits. The keyboard is from an old cash register. And only one 4 digit display.
